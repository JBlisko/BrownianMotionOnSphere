# Brownian Motion on Sphere
MATLAB implementation of Brownian motion of quadrupolar particles on spherical surface. We consider a capillary force for quadrupolar particles, excluded volume, hydrodynamic interactions, and a random walk governed by the Weiner process. The particles are confined to the surface of the spherical particle by the use of a restoring spring force, which applies a force normal to the surface proportional to the displacement of the particle from the surface of the droplet. We normalize by the use of standard dimensionless values in fluid mechanics. This was completed in my Junior year of college, and is not as complete as I would like.
